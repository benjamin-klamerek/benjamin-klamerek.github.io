Main page about every that I did about my roller shutters.

Model used : etersky WF-CS01

Why flashing ?

- Avoid using external server to send a command (Internet not required)
- Build a future common remote controller for all devices at once
- Build advanced workflows (like open partially depending on the day or sun detection)
